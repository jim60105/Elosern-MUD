## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A full-screen overlay is one focus-trapped surface, and only one is open at a time
A full-screen overlay SHALL render as one shared surface laid over the stage, carrying a header naming
the surface and a labelled close control, with its body as its only scrolling region. The surface is fixed
from the stage's 46px command-line height (`top:46px; left:0; right:0; bottom:0`), so the command line
stays visible and usable underneath it. While an overlay
is open it SHALL trap keyboard focus, so no surface behind it is reachable by sequential navigation. It
SHALL close on Escape and on activation of its close control, and both paths SHALL restore focus to the
control that opened it. It SHALL use the shared focus trap the client already owns rather than a second
implementation.

At most one overlay SHALL be open at any time; opening a second SHALL close the first, and the opener
recorded for the replacement is the control that opened it, so closing restores focus to the most recent
trigger, never to the trigger of the closed overlay. An overlay and a
reference drawer SHALL NOT be open together: opening either SHALL close the other, so at most one
focus-trapped surface exists at any moment. An open overlay SHALL register itself as an open surface so
the stage recession this capability already requires applies without a second mechanism.

Escape SHALL be resolved by a single precedence order, topmost first — a popover open inside the open
overlay, then the open overlay, then an open drawer, then the focused command field, then the dock's
current menu level — with each level consuming the key and stopping. A popover open inside an overlay
SHALL close on Escape without closing the overlay, keeping focus inside the overlay, and the next
Escape SHALL close the overlay; while no such popover is open, Escape closes the overlay as above.

A mode change into creation, a presentation-epoch reset and a loss of the transport SHALL each close
every open overlay. The mode-driven character-creation surface SHALL NOT be part of this single-open
stack, because it is not opened by the player and a utility control must never dismiss it.

#### Scenario: An overlay opens, traps focus, and returns it
- **WHEN** the player activates an overlay trigger, cycles focus forward past the overlay's last control and backward past its first, and then presses Escape
- **THEN** focus stays inside the overlay in both directions, the overlay closes on Escape, and focus returns to the trigger that opened it

#### Scenario: Only one overlay is open at a time
- **WHEN** an overlay is open and the player activates a different overlay's trigger
- **THEN** the first overlay closes as the second opens, and exactly one overlay is present

#### Scenario: An overlay and a drawer are never open together
- **WHEN** a reference drawer is open and the player activates an overlay trigger
- **THEN** the drawer closes as the overlay opens, and exactly one focus-trapped surface is present

#### Scenario: Escape resolves at exactly one level
- **WHEN** an overlay is open above a focused command field and a dock frame at depth two, and the player presses Escape once
- **THEN** the overlay closes, focus returns to its trigger, the command field's content is untouched, and the dock's menu depth is unchanged

#### Scenario: Closing the last overlay clears the recession
- **WHEN** the open overlay closes and no drawer remains open
- **THEN** the stage's recession mark is cleared

#### Scenario: A creation transition closes the overlays
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes to creation while an overlay is open
- **THEN** that overlay closes, focus is routed to the action dock, and the character-creation surface is not itself treated as one of the single-open overlays

#### Scenario: An overlay's own popover takes Escape first
- **WHEN** the full-map overlay is open with its legend popover expanded, and the player presses Escape twice
- **THEN** the first Escape closes only the popover and focus stays inside the overlay, and the second Escape closes the overlay and returns focus to the trigger that opened it

### Requirement: The map, settings, and help surfaces are reachable from the live client
The map, settings and help surfaces SHALL each be reachable from the running client by a labelled
control, not only from the component showcase. The minimap island SHALL carry a labelled control that
opens the map surface, rendered as a sibling of its map canvas rather than as a wrapper around its
actionable nodes; the island's non-interactive body MAY additionally open the same surface on pointer
click, which SHALL NOT replace or wrap the labelled control. The command line's utility controls SHALL
open the settings and help surfaces.

The map surface SHALL render the committed `local_map` payload through the same component the minimap
island renders, and SHALL re-render its available and unavailable branches whenever that read model is
replaced, so a superseded payload never leaves a stale map or a stale reason on screen; when a newly
committed payload resolves to the other layout variant, the surface follows the resolved value with no
control of its own. It SHALL open fitted, showing the whole drawing inside its body, and SHALL offer
exactly the view affordances the full-map fit-view requirement of the local-map capability defines —
wheel and `+` / `-` zoom within that requirement's bounds, labelled 放大 and 縮小 buttons, drag-pan, a
labelled 置中 button that recentres the current node, and a `?` disclosure button named 圖例 that opens
the state legend in a popover — and it SHALL name those gestures in words in its guide row. Those
affordances change only the view of the drawing: none of them SHALL change the committed payload, the
resolved layout variant, or any geometry the surface declares, and none SHALL be persisted. It SHALL
render no bearing, compass angle, distance, or coordinate figure, on any layer, and no zoom level,
scale ratio, or other figure describing the view.

The map surface's body SHALL carry the redesign draft's map-canvas framing (the radial-gradient dark
terrain background painted as pure CSS inside a rounded ink border), and SHALL NOT fabricate terrain
geometry the payload does not claim.

The help surface SHALL render the client's own control reference — the keys this client binds, the dock's
navigation model, the quick-word chips and the close paths — from a single client-owned source, and SHALL
state how the game's own help output is reached. It SHALL NOT render authored game-help content for which
no committed panel exists, and SHALL NOT stand a placeholder in for it.

#### Scenario: Each surface has a live trigger
- **WHEN** the client renders in exploration mode with the `local_map` panel committed
- **THEN** the minimap island carries a labelled control that opens the map surface, and the command line carries labelled controls that open the settings and help surfaces

#### Scenario: The map surface tracks read-model replacement in the live client
- **WHEN** the map surface is open and an update replaces the committed `local_map` payload with the registry-owned unavailable form, and then with a different available payload
- **THEN** the surface renders only the registry-owned reason, then the replacement map, and at no point shows a map or a reason from the superseded payload

#### Scenario: The map surface advertises no zoom or pan
- **WHEN** the map surface renders on any layer
- **THEN** its only view controls are the labelled 縮小, 放大, and 置中 buttons and the 圖例 disclosure
  button, its guide row names the wheel, `+` / `-`, and drag gestures in words, the legend appears only
  inside the 圖例 popover, and no zoom level, scale ratio, bearing, compass angle, or distance figure
  appears anywhere on the surface

#### Scenario: The map surface frames the draft canvas without invented terrain
- **WHEN** the map surface renders an available payload
- **THEN** the map body shows the radial-gradient ink background inside the rounded ink frame, and no terrain, coastline, or route geometry is drawn that the payload does not carry

#### Scenario: The help surface tells the truth about what it knows
- **WHEN** the help surface renders with no committed panel carrying authored guide content
- **THEN** it renders the client's own control reference and a statement of how the game's help output is reached, and it renders no authored game-help entry and no placeholder standing in for one
