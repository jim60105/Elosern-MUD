## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The shipped NPC roster is validated as complete before the game starts
Before any world synchronization at server start, the system SHALL validate the complete shipped NPC roster and SHALL abort startup when any check fails, reporting every violation with its source kind, source key, and profile key. The checks SHALL be: the inventory equals the sources derived from the live registries and example files in both directions; every place host, guild examiner, and starting-companion declaration resolves to a profile with a valid compact card; every offline quest template occupant and every shipped NPC import example carries a valid compact card; every dialogue table is answered by exactly one profiled hosted place; every profile behind a scripted-dialogue host authors a misunderstanding reply and no greeting (its table greeting is the single source), and every companion profile authors a greeting; and no profile exists that no source references. The same validation SHALL be runnable in tests without a server.

#### Scenario: The shipped roster passes
- **WHEN** the roster validation runs against the shipped registries and examples
- **THEN** it reports no violation and startup proceeds

#### Scenario: A missing profile aborts startup by name
- **WHEN** a synthetic registry set contains a hosted place whose profile key resolves to nothing
- **THEN** validation fails naming the place's source key and the missing profile, and no world synchronization runs

#### Scenario: Missing voice coverage is reported
- **WHEN** a synthetic scripted host's profile authors no misunderstanding reply, or a synthetic companion profile authors no greeting
- **THEN** validation fails naming each profile and the missing voice line

#### Scenario: An orphan profile is reported
- **WHEN** a synthetic profile is registered that no place, rank, or declaration references
- **THEN** validation fails naming the orphan profile

#### Scenario: All violations are reported together
- **WHEN** a synthetic registry set has an inventory mismatch and an invalid template card
- **THEN** one failure lists both violations
