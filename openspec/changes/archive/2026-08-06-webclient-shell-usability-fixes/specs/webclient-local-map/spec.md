## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The browser minimap renders states without relying on color alone
The WebClient `local-map` component SHALL render the validated `local_map` panel, replacing the foundation placeholder. It SHALL distinguish `current`, `visible_*`, and `remembered` states by label/shape/border in addition to color, SHALL render the legend's text labels, SHALL allow focusing a remembered remote node to view its name/landmark without any travel action, and SHALL omit unknown nodes. On reconnect it SHALL rebuild the map from the server-persisted knowledge in the new epoch's snapshot; no client map cache is authoritative.

Layout SHALL be computed in the DOM-independent render model as a bounded integer lattice, not as a rescaling of payload coordinates into a fixed pixel box. The model SHALL place only current-field-of-view nodes (`current`, `visible_unvisited`, `visible_visited`) on that lattice, deriving each node's column and row from its payload coordinates relative to the minimum in-view coordinate, and SHALL export the lattice's column and row counts. When that span would exceed 64 columns or 64 rows, the model SHALL fall back to rank compression over the distinct sorted coordinate values, which cannot exceed the payload's node bound. The renderer SHALL size the map canvas from the exported lattice so the canvas reserves its own space and the pane scrolls, and SHALL NOT allow map content to overlap the legend, the detail line, or any other pane content. Node labels SHALL occupy a single line with an overflow indicator, and each node's full label SHALL remain available as its accessible name.

`remembered` nodes SHALL be presented as a bounded, focusable list outside the coordinate canvas, retaining their non-color state indicator and their focus-only, no-travel behavior. Their payload coordinates describe locations outside the current field of view and SHALL NOT influence the lattice. Edges SHALL be drawn as connector lines between node centers in a non-interactive layer built through element constructors, SHALL NOT intercept node activation, and SHALL carry their label as an accessible name rather than as positioned visible text; an edge with an endpoint that is not on the canvas SHALL be omitted from the drawn layer. The `local_map` payload contract, the visibility states, the `未探索` unvisited-node rule, the remembered-node no-travel rule, and `explore.move` submission SHALL all remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Focused remembered node offers no travel action
- **WHEN** the player focuses a remembered remote node in the minimap
- **THEN** its name and landmark are shown and there is no move or travel control for it

#### Scenario: State distinction does not depend on color alone
- **WHEN** the minimap renders current, visible, and remembered nodes
- **THEN** each state is distinguishable by non-color indicators (shape, border, or text label) and the legend text is readable

#### Scenario: Reconnect rebuilds from persisted knowledge
- **WHEN** the WebSocket reconnects and a new-epoch snapshot arrives
- **THEN** the minimap is rebuilt from the server-persisted visited record and current location, and no client-stored map state is treated as authoritative

#### Scenario: Unknown panel schema disables only the minimap
- **WHEN** a received `local_map` payload fails its exact schema
- **THEN** only the minimap renderer is disabled, the browser requests at most one full resynchronization, and narrative and text input remain usable

#### Scenario: In-view nodes occupy distinct lattice cells
- **WHEN** a grid-layer payload places several in-view nodes at distinct coordinates
- **THEN** each node occupies its own lattice cell, no two node markers overlap, and their relative row and column order matches the payload coordinates

#### Scenario: Distant remembered nodes do not distort the local view
- **WHEN** the payload carries remembered nodes many cells away from the current node
- **THEN** the lattice is computed only from the in-view nodes, the local neighbourhood keeps its spacing, and the remembered nodes appear in the bounded list rather than on the canvas

#### Scenario: Map content stays inside its pane
- **WHEN** the minimap renders in the shell's local-map pane at 1440x900 and at 1280x720
- **THEN** the canvas reserves its own height, the legend and detail line remain readable below it, and no node marker or edge overprints other pane content

#### Scenario: A geometrically sparse payload stays bounded
- **WHEN** a schema-valid payload places in-view nodes at coordinates whose span exceeds the lattice bound
- **THEN** the model falls back to rank compression, the lattice stays within its bound, and every node is still rendered exactly once
