# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Companion standing portraits line up behind the controlled character in the actor-left anchor
The `actor-left` anchor SHALL render the currently controlled character's standing portrait as the group's rightmost figure with highest baseline z, and SHALL render each companion in committed `party.slots` order to its left, forming an overlapping horizontal row. Each figure SHALL reuse the existing StageActor rendering and remain non-interactive decorative art: no focusable element, no pointer events.

#### Scenario: Portraits resolve through the catalog
- **WHEN** a companion portrait renders
- **THEN** it resolves from `portrait_ref` through `art.portrait_catalog`, falling back to its display name's initial-letter placeholder when null or unresolved

#### Scenario: Every figure shares one size and ground line
- **WHEN** the lineup renders any number of figures
- **THEN** every figure, including the controlled character, has the same full anchor size and ground line; no progressively smaller scale, lift ramp or depth dimming

#### Scenario: The row compresses to stay in the left half
- **WHEN** the row renders at 1451x790, 1741x948 and 2560x1440, in any mode
- **THEN** horizontal overlap compresses as necessary to keep the row inside the stage's left half, preserving a scaled left gutter; a multi-figure group MAY shift horizontally within that half; in dialogue the group compresses overlap to clear the choice list without resizing figures; zero companions render the existing solo portrait at its standard anchor position; the anchor has `overflow: visible`; and the vitals dock MAY cover the lowest strip of feet, never face or torso

#### Scenario: Visibility follows the mode
- **WHEN** the committed mode is exploration, combat, dialogue, or creation
- **THEN** the lineup is visible in exploration, combat and dialogue, and hidden in creation

#### Scenario: A speaking companion rises in z only
- **WHEN** a non-controlled rendered companion is the active host speaker in dialogue mode or the selected surviving exploration verb-card target, and when that speaking/focus changes or ends
- **THEN** companions use the existing StageActor listener dim otherwise; the speaking companion temporarily receives z above every baseline figure, returning to its exact baseline z when speaking changes or ends, including across possession swaps and lineup count changes; dialogue speaking and exploration focus change only dim and z, never position, lift or size, and remains correct at off/reduced motion; and the controlled figure retains its existing speaking and beat behavior

#### Scenario: No figure crosses the stage's centre
- **WHEN** the lineup and the foe lineup render together
- **THEN** no figure box crosses the stage's horizontal centre, and the foe lineup is unchanged

#### Scenario: A two-companion party renders a three-figure group
- **WHEN** the committed `party` panel carries two resolved-portrait slots at 1451x790 in exploration mode
- **THEN** three equally sized figures share a ground line, the player is rightmost with highest baseline z, the companions overlap leftward in party order, no box crosses the horizontal centre and no figure is focusable

#### Scenario: A zero-companion party renders only the player
- **WHEN** the committed `party` panel is available with an empty `slots` list
- **THEN** the `actor-left` anchor renders the player's solo portrait at the standard standing position, byte-stable with the solo layout before this change

#### Scenario: A companion with no portrait shows the initial letter
- **WHEN** a party slot carries `portrait_ref: null` for display name `蕾娜`
- **THEN** that figure renders the initial `蕾` through the stage actor's truthful placeholder, with no invented image or constructed URL

#### Scenario: The full party fits the left half at every viewport
- **WHEN** the committed party carries four slots and the shell renders at 1451x790 and at 2560x1440
- **THEN** all five equally sized figures render with compressed horizontal overlap inside the left half; in exploration/combat each face is at least partially visible, and in dialogue a speaking companion is brought above the overlapping listeners without moving its slot

#### Scenario: A speaking companion rises temporarily without moving
- **WHEN** the committed dialogue host is a companion and the existing speaker signal changes from player to host and back
- **THEN** that companion changes from dim baseline z to lit highest z and back, preserving its exact geometry; possession swaps, lineup changes and off motion cannot retain stale speaking z

#### Scenario: The companion line and the foe line-up do not overlap
- **WHEN** the committed mode is combat with two companions and three active foes at 1451x790
- **THEN** no companion figure's rendered box intersects any foe figure's rendered box

#### Scenario: Exploration reuses companion emphasis
- **WHEN** a verb card opens for a non-controlled rendered companion while another companion and the controlled figure are present
- **THEN** only the selected companion gains the existing highest focus z and loses listener dim; the other companion keeps baseline/listener dim and the controlled figure keeps its independent dim/beat behavior, without position, size or ground-line changes

#### Scenario: Exploration closure restores current baselines
- **WHEN** that card closes through back, look-close, departure, movement or invalidation, including after lineup count changes
- **THEN** the surviving non-controlled figures use the current geometry's exact baseline z and listener dim with no remembered focus z, at full, reduced and off motion

#### Scenario: Possession preserves the controlled role during focus
- **WHEN** possession/release swaps the front figure while an exploration card is open
- **THEN** identity joins use the current rendered figures, a selected non-controlled companion can be emphasized at its current slot, and the controlled front never receives companion-listener elevation or loses its existing beat/dim semantics
