## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The guild surface covers registration, board, quest log, and rank examination
The guild section SHALL retain its existing exact branch/rank/registration/board/quests/exam shape, local GuildStaff gate and read-only ownership. Quest rows SHALL accept invalidated and add nullable bounded terminal_reason; invalidated rows SHALL have disabled abandon/turn-in. Private escort abandonment is a separate host-independent quest_log descriptor using the same action ID, and SHALL not make a guild section available without staff.

#### Scenario: Unregistered player can register
- **WHEN** an unregistered actor stands in the guild hall
- **THEN** `registration.register` is enabled with the `guild.register` action and `board` contains no offers

#### Scenario: F member sees only rank-eligible board offers
- **WHEN** a registered F member stands in a hall whose board contains an F offer and an E offer
- **THEN** `board` contains only the F offer row and its `accept` carries the offer's definition key

#### Scenario: Quest log rows carry full server-rendered detail
- **WHEN** the actor has one active `introductory_hunt` record
- **THEN** the row names the quest, reports `in_progress`, carries stage/progress, a deadline line when set, and a `detail` string identical to the deterministic detail renderer, with `abandon` enabled and `turnin` null-disabled

#### Scenario: Quest log rows disclose tracking truth
- **WHEN** the actor tracks one active quest and leaves another active
- **THEN** the tracked row carries `tracked` true and the untracked row carries `tracked` false, and no other field differs from the untracked baseline

#### Scenario: Completed quest offers exactly-once turn-in preview
- **WHEN** the actor has a completed, unclaimed record at the local branch
- **THEN** the row's `turnin` is enabled with the `guild.quest_turnin` action and the quest ID, and after the claim is recorded the same row's `turnin` becomes disabled with a stable already-claimed reason

#### Scenario: Exam eligibility shows the exact next rank only
- **WHEN** a registered F member has merit at or above the E threshold and no active session
- **THEN** `rank` reports the exact next rank E and enables `exam_request` with payload `{target_rank: "E"}`, and no other rank can be selected

#### Scenario: Guild surface stays read-only
- **WHEN** the guild section is built for an actor with registration, an active quest, and eligible exam state
- **THEN** registration, quest log, merit, rank, wallet, and exam records are byte-for-byte unchanged

#### Scenario: Below merit request stays enabled
- **WHEN** a registered next-rank member below true merit threshold stands at a functioning guild counter and the qualified host is absent
- **THEN** merit_qualified is false, exam_request is enabled and dispatch returns exam_schedule without mutation

#### Scenario: Registration section shape and enablement gate
- **WHEN** the `registration` section is built
- **THEN** it contains exactly `registered` (boolean) and `register` (an action descriptor), and `register` is
  enabled only for an unregistered actor with one local `GuildStaff` host and otherwise carries a stable disabled
  reason

#### Scenario: Board rows carry their exact fields in board API order
- **WHEN** the `board` list ships
- **THEN** it holds at most 12 offer rows in the deterministic rank/key order returned by the board API, each
  containing exactly `definition_key`, `display_name`, `category`, `rank`, `objective_summary`, `objective_note`,
  `deadline_line`, `rationale`, `flavor`, `reward`, and `accept`, and no `reward_summary`

#### Scenario: Board accept gates on eligibility and no active record
- **WHEN** a board offer row's `accept` descriptor is computed
- **THEN** it is enabled only while that offer is board-eligible and the actor has no active record for it

#### Scenario: Quest rows carry their exact fields in record order
- **WHEN** the services quests list ships
- **THEN** the existing bounded ordered row shape, including tracked, adds terminal_reason; state accepts in_progress/completed/failed/invalidated, detail stays canonical, and invalidated reasons are present with no enabled terminal mutation

#### Scenario: Abandon enables only for an in-progress record at a staff host
- **WHEN** a guild-section quest row abandon descriptor is computed
- **THEN** the existing guild counter descriptor retains its active-record/local-staff gate; private escort quest_log descriptors separately require owned active escort state and no staff

#### Scenario: Turn-in requires an unclaimed completed record at a staff host
- **WHEN** a guild quest row turnin descriptor is computed
- **THEN** the existing local staff, completed and unclaimed gates remain, grouped records additionally require selected-winner entitlement, and invalidated records never enable turn-in

#### Scenario: Rank section presence and exact fields
- **WHEN** the `rank` section is computed
- **THEN** it is present only when exactly one local examination counter (the `GuildExaminer` counter of the
  hall) resolves, whether or not the qualified persistent host is present, and contains exactly `rank`, `merit`,
  `next_rank`, `next_threshold`, `merit_qualified`, and `exam_request`

#### Scenario: Exam start requires every condition and the next-rank payload
- **WHEN** `exam_request` is computed
- **THEN** it is enabled only when the actor is registered at the counter's branch, an exact next rank exists,
  and the local counter passes its service and schedule gates; merit and host presence never disable it, and its
  action payload carries exactly the next-rank key

#### Scenario: Unregistered and top-rank actors receive stable target reasons
- **WHEN** the actor is unregistered or already holds the top rank
- **THEN** `exam_request` is disabled with the stable `unregistered` or `top_rank` reason and never with a merit
  reason



### Requirement: Service actions are exact, allowlisted, and server-authoritative
The existing service action allowlist and exact bounded payloads SHALL remain. guild.quest_abandon SHALL revalidate the authenticated owner and referenced record. Active private escort records MAY abandon without a guild host through the quest-owned compensated operation; ordinary guild counter actions retain existing host/eligibility gates. No new action ID or actor/host authority field SHALL be added.

#### Scenario: Existing registration reaches its deterministic API once
- **WHEN** an unregistered actor submits an empty `guild.register` at the local guild hall
- **THEN** the adapter resolves the local staff host and calls `register_adventurer`, and the snapshot thereafter reports rank F with the recorded branch

#### Scenario: Repeated registration is idempotent
- **WHEN** a registered actor submits an empty `guild.register` again after a state change between render and submit
- **THEN** the adapter returns the original record without replacing branch, tick, or snapshot, reports success, and refreshes canonical services/status panels

#### Scenario: Quest accept is board-gated
- **WHEN** a registered member submits `guild.quest_accept` with a visible definition key
- **THEN** the adapter revalidates board eligibility and creates exactly the deterministic quest record

#### Scenario: Quest tracking rides the lifecycle operation anywhere
- **WHEN** a holder submits `guild.quest_track` with a tracked-true payload for one of their active quests while standing outside any guild hall
- **THEN** the adapter calls the tracking operation exactly once, the commit reports success, and the refreshed payload reports the row's `tracked` true

#### Scenario: The tracking cap refusal mutates nothing
- **WHEN** a holder with three tracked active quests submits a fourth `guild.quest_track` tracked-true payload
- **THEN** the dispatch rejects with the lifecycle module's bounded refusal message and every record's tracking state is unchanged

#### Scenario: Exam start cannot choose an examiner or rank
- **WHEN** a client submits a non-next rank or includes a host, examiner, branch, clock or threshold field
- **THEN** exact validation or the coordinator rejects before any exam creation and only the exact next-rank payload is accepted

#### Scenario: Existing buy and sell submit only item and quantity
- **WHEN** a client submits `shop.buy` with item key and quantity only
- **THEN** the adapter re-resolves and rechecks the local merchant before calling deterministic economy settlement

#### Scenario: Inventory use submits only item key
- **WHEN** a client submits `inventory.use` with one item key
- **THEN** the adapter resolves current actor mode and delegates to the matching deterministic item-use facade exactly once

#### Scenario: Inventory toggle submits only item key
- **WHEN** a client submits `inventory.toggle_equip` with one item key
- **THEN** the adapter delegates to deterministic equipment toggle without accepting a client-selected slot

#### Scenario: Authority-like fields can never be supplied
- **WHEN** any service or inventory action contains an unknown actor, host, session, effect, or slot-like field
- **THEN** exact-schema validation rejects before adapter invocation

#### Scenario: Below merit request stays enabled
- **WHEN** a registered next-rank member below true merit threshold stands at a functioning guild counter and the qualified host is absent
- **THEN** merit_qualified is false, exam_request is enabled and dispatch returns exam_schedule without mutation

#### Scenario: Payload schemas are exact and bounded
- **WHEN** any service action payload is validated
- **THEN** `guild.register` accepts exactly an empty payload, guild quest and exam actions retain their exact
  bounded identifiers, `guild.quest_track` accepts exactly `quest_id` (the shared bounded quest identifier) and
  boolean `tracked`, and `shop.buy` and `shop.sell` retain exactly bounded `item_key` and integer `quantity`

#### Scenario: Registration idempotency is retained
- **WHEN** registration is submitted again after the actor is already registered
- **THEN** `guild.register` retains its current idempotency

#### Scenario: Inventory actions carry only a bounded item key
- **WHEN** an `inventory.use` or `inventory.toggle_equip` payload is validated
- **THEN** it accepts exactly `item_key` as a 1..64-character non-empty string

#### Scenario: Adapters are session-scoped and re-resolve everything
- **WHEN** a service adapter runs
- **THEN** it resolves the authenticated actor and referenced canonical state, resolves local hosts where the action requires them, and delegates to the existing public owner; private escort abandonment needs no guild staff

#### Scenario: Inventory payloads reject every authority field
- **WHEN** an inventory payload carries any of actor, host, branch, session, effect, consumable, quantity, target,
  slot, HP, combat, price, stock, or wallet fields
- **THEN** exact-schema validation rejects it

#### Scenario: Adapters never write canonical state directly
- **WHEN** any adapter settles
- **THEN** no adapter assigns `.db`, traits, registration, rank, merit, quest log, wallet, inventory, equipment,
  merchant stock, location, combat, or clock state directly

#### Scenario: Actions never route through the text parser
- **WHEN** any service or inventory action is dispatched
- **THEN** no action routes an action ID or payload through the text command parser

#### Scenario: Host-independent escort abandonment uses the existing action
- **WHEN** a holder confirms guild.quest_abandon for an active owned private escort away from a counter
- **THEN** the unchanged quest_id payload invokes compensated abandonment once, releases only that record's sources and refreshes committed quest/party/dialogue state

#### Scenario: Forged terminal or foreign abandonment is refused
- **WHEN** a stale, invalidated, non-owned or foreign quest ID is submitted as a private escort abandonment
- **THEN** current domain authorization refuses without control, membership, quest or reward mutation
