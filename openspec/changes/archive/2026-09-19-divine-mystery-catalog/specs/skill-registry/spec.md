## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The seed registry spans every skill category inventoried from the sample cards
`SKILL_REGISTRY` SHALL include at least one representative `SkillDef` for each of: stat multipliers,
elemental mastery, direct spells, weapon arts, the display-only disguise skill, the partial-conferral
skill, ordinary passives, and at least one per-character-unique passive — without requiring an
exhaustive transcription of every skill mentioned on every sample card.

#### Scenario: At least one stat-multiplier skill exists for each documented tier
- **WHEN** `SKILL_REGISTRY` is inspected
- **THEN** it contains entries whose `effects` include a `stat_multiply:` entry at `100`-scale,
  `1000`-scale, and a third, smaller scale for the "basic" tier

#### Scenario: All four elemental-mastery skills are present
- **WHEN** `SKILL_REGISTRY` is inspected
- **THEN** it contains a `PASSIVE` entry for fire, dark, wind, and light mastery, each with `element`
  set to the corresponding `world.lore.elements.ELEMENT_REGISTRY` entry

#### Scenario: The conferral skill (統御術) and the disguise skill (狀態偽裝) are both present
- **WHEN** `SKILL_REGISTRY` is inspected
- **THEN** it contains at least one `ACTIVE` entry whose `effects` include `"confer_skill_partial"`
  with `dominion_art` among them, and at least one `ACTIVE` entry whose `effects` include
  `"set_disguise"` with `status_disguise` among them

#### Scenario: At least three per-character-unique passives exist under distinct keys
- **WHEN** `SKILL_REGISTRY` is inspected
- **THEN** it contains at least three distinct keys representing a 轉生特典-pattern passive, each with
  a different `effects` entry, none sharing a single generic "reincarnation boon" key
