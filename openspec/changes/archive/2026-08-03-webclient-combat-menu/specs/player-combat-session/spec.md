## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Player combat submission accepts one explicit target value
`submit_player_action(actor, skill_key, targets_or_shorthand)` SHALL accept only a concrete list of live participant objects or one of `all-enemies`, `all-allies`, and `all`. It SHALL reject any other scalar, a duplicate explicit participant, or a participant outside the current reconstructed session before initiative. Player-facing NONE and SELF SHALL require an empty list; the facade SHALL bind that empty SELF input to the actor and leave NONE empty. SINGLE SHALL receive exactly one explicit participant, and AREA SHALL receive a nonempty explicit list or one approved shorthand. The facade SHALL retain battlefield reconstruction, shared preview, `ActionResolver.preflight()`, initiative, overwhelm dispatch, session persistence, terminal settlement, and recovery ownership. No single-object compatibility overload SHALL exist.

#### Scenario: Explicit AREA participants drive one round
- **WHEN** a player submits an AREA skill with two distinct current enemy objects
- **THEN** the facade builds one ActionRequest containing both canonical participants and drives the existing one-round or overwhelm path once

#### Scenario: Approved shorthand reaches ordinary targeting
- **WHEN** a player submits an AREA skill with `all-enemies`
- **THEN** the facade preserves the shorthand for ActionResolver expansion and every resulting candidate passes ordinary target validation

#### Scenario: Old single-object input is not retained
- **WHEN** a production caller passes one participant object instead of a list
- **THEN** the facade rejects the malformed call before initiative rather than wrapping it through a compatibility branch

### Requirement: Telnet combat discovery and target tokens have rule parity
`combat actions` SHALL list every owned active skill in deterministic handler order and assign session-local target tokens from persisted participant order: `a1`, `a2`, and so on for `player_ids`, then `e1`, `e2`, and so on for `enemy_ids`. A token SHALL remain bound to the same dbref for the session lifetime and SHALL never be persisted separately. Active-session `cast` SHALL accept one token, a comma-separated list containing tokens only, or one complete approved AREA shorthand; it SHALL retain existing one-target display-name search. Comma input SHALL reject names, unknown or duplicate tokens, and shorthand/token mixtures before initiative.

#### Scenario: Combat actions lists stable tokens and active skills
- **WHEN** a Telnet player requests `combat actions` before and after one nonterminal round
- **THEN** the same participant dbrefs retain the same `aN` and `eN` tokens and active skills retain stored order

#### Scenario: Comma-separated tokens submit AREA targets
- **WHEN** the player enters `cast wind_blade=e1,e2`
- **THEN** both tokens resolve from the active record and the same explicit-list facade used by the WebClient receives those participants

#### Scenario: Single display-name lookup remains available
- **WHEN** the player enters one unambiguous existing target name on the right-hand side
- **THEN** the command resolves that one target through existing search and submits it as a one-element list

#### Scenario: Mixed syntax cannot bypass target rules
- **WHEN** the player enters a duplicate token list, a token mixed with a display name, or `all-enemies,e1`
- **THEN** the command rejects before preview, initiative, round count, or world-time change
