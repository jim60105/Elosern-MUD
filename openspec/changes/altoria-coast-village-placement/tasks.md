# Tasks

Test prefix: `uv run --locked --env-file=/tmp/mud-test.env evennia test --settings test_settings.py --keepdb`
(`/tmp/mud-test.env` contains the single line `MUD_TEST_SETTINGS=1`; create it if missing).
Run only the focused labels named below, one command per label. Never run a whole test suite for this change.

Ground rules:
- Change only these files, plus residual-pin test rewrites under the "Residual pin rule" of `docs/development/settlement-synthesis.md`:
  - new rows in `content/maps/locations.yaml` and `world/lore/anchors.py`;
  - new `content/maps/settlements/<id>.yaml` files for the new IDs;
  - `tools/settlement_spacing_areas.json`;
  - `world/maps/data/road_network.json`, `world/maps/data/district_partition.json`, `content/map-reference-context.json`;
  - files under `openspec/changes/altoria-coast-village-placement/`.

- Never hand-edit generated YAML or a generated artifact.
- Keep previews, captures and prose JSON in the scratchpad, outside the repository.
- Ask before writing if the map editor has one of these documents open.

## 1. Baseline

- [ ] 1.1 Confirm the prerequisites: `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_spacing` prints `spacing: 0 problems`, `uv run --locked python -m tools.road_network --check` exits 0, `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_synthesis generate --help` lists `--kind`, and `tools/settlement_spacing_areas.json` equals the "Before" content of design D7. If any fails, stop and report.
- [ ] 1.2 Record the first timing line of design D9. Verify: the line is saved for the hand-off.
- [ ] 1.3 Write the placement script per design D1 and list the road gaps over 75 km inside this change's scope. Verify: the list is saved under `snippets/` and names each gap's road, end cells and length.

## 2. Villages

- [ ] 2.1 Propose villages, approve each against design D2 and D3, and write the rows of design D4. Verify: `place_sites.py --locations` (command in design Context) reports every new cell walkable, off the water and of nation `altoria`, and `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_spacing` reports no problem except `village_off_road` for the new villages.
- [ ] 2.2 Regenerate per design D6. Verify: `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_spacing` reports no `village_off_road`, and every new village ID appears as a `spur_of` value in `world/maps/data/road_network.json`.

## 3. Hamlets

- [ ] 3.1 Propose hamlets against the regenerated roads, approve each against design D2 and D3, and write the rows of design D4. Verify: `place_sites.py --locations` reports every new cell valid, and `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_spacing` reports no `hamlet_spacing`, `village_spacing`, `id_prefix`, `duplicate_name`, `no_nation`, `nation_mismatch`, `population_range` or `forbidden_region` problem.
- [ ] 3.2 Regenerate per design D6 and make the trunk comparison of D6. Verify: no road row without `spur_of` changed.

## 4. Maps and prose

- [ ] 4.1 Run `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_synthesis generate --missing --nation altoria --kind village --plan-only`, then without `--plan-only`; then the same two commands with `--kind hamlet`. Verify: each new ID has exactly one new file, no existing settlement file changed (`git status --short content/maps/settlements` shows only additions), and `uv run --locked python -m tools.settlement_synthesis lint` exits 0. A refusal is fixed by moving that location and repeating from group 2 or 3; never by hand-writing a map.
- [ ] 4.2 Write and apply the prose of every new map per design D5a. Verify: `brief` of each new map shows no empty description and no duplicate key.
- [ ] 4.3 Regenerate per design D6. Verify: compared with the artifact of task 3.2 (keep a copy in the scratchpad), the only changed line of `world/maps/data/road_network.json` is `source_signature`.

## 5. Validation and hand-off

- [ ] 5.1 Replace `tools/settlement_spacing_areas.json` with the "After" content of design D7 and run the four checks of D7. Verify: all four hold. Fix a `road_gap` as D7 says and repeat the affected groups.
- [ ] 5.2 Run every module of `docs/development/settlement-synthesis.md` § Settlement-sensitive test modules, one per command, plus `world.lore.tests.test_anchors` and `world.maps.tests.test_population_geometry` with the test prefix. Verify: every one passes. Handle a failure with that section's "Residual pin rule" and list every rewritten test in the hand-off. Any other failure stops the change without a commit.
- [ ] 5.3 Capture the continent with `capture_map.py --hide partition` and the settlement views of two new villages and two new hamlets (one on a through road, one at a spur end, one off-road where one exists). Read the images. Verify: the hand-off gives the absolute path of each image and of the last road preview, and states for each captured map which road each entrance meets.
- [ ] 5.4 Record the second timing line of design D9, then run `uv run --locked python -m tools.test_data_lint check`, `uv run --locked python -m tools.contract_gate` and `openspec validate altoria-coast-village-placement --strict`. Verify: all exit 0. The hand-off lists the count of villages and hamlets, every exemption with its reason, every hamlet placed under the boundary exception of D2, and both timing lines.

## Workflow follow-up

- After merge, the user reviews the new maps and markers in the map editor and the webclient. The review does not block archive.
