## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The WebClient renders a full-bleed cinematic stage with anchored HUD surfaces
The WebClient SHALL render as a full-bleed stage that fills the viewport, with the scene backdrop as
the lowest layer, the portrait anchors above it, the HUD islands above those, the bottom band above
those, and the command line topmost among the persistent surfaces. HUD surfaces SHALL be placed by
named stage anchors — the `place` anchor, the island anchors `hud-left` and `hud-right`, the portrait anchors
`actor-left` and `actor-right`, the bottom band's two regions `band-message` and `band-command`, and
the `command-line` row — and SHALL NOT be placed inside a page-scrolling container that can push a
required surface out of view.

The top band SHALL be 48px tall at every supported viewport and SHALL carry only the brand, the top
navigation bar, the possession banner when present, the character switcher, and the connection
state; it SHALL carry no location label and no time label. The `place` anchor SHALL sit at the stage
box's top-left corner, below the top band, at a fixed height that does not depend on the label
lengths it holds, and the `hud-left` anchor SHALL begin below it.

The bottom band SHALL span the full stage width along the stage's bottom edge at one fixed height,
`clamp(260px, 27.8vh, 400px)` (300px at the 1920x1080 reference viewport), taken from a single
shared band-height token. The band's height SHALL NOT depend on its content, on the dock frame, on
the committed mode, or on any measurement: no frame, pane, line count, dialogue exchange, or mode
change SHALL grow or shrink it. The band SHALL be divided into the message region `band-message`,
covering the left two thirds of the band's width, and the command region `band-command`, covering
the remaining right third; in creation mode, where the message region is hidden, the command region
SHALL span the whole band. The band SHALL carry the reference's band chrome (the upward gradient,
the hairline top border, and the upward shadow) on the band itself, not on the content inside it.
The stage box — the region between the top band's lower edge and the bottom band's upper edge — is
where the scene is seen, and at the 1920x1080 reference viewport it SHALL be at least 65% of the
viewport's height — at least 702px of 1080; the 48px top band and the 300px bottom band leave 731px. Every surface other than the band SHALL be positioned relative to the
band-height token so that none of them overlaps the band.

The portrait anchors SHALL stand on the band: each SHALL be bottom-aligned to the band's upper edge,
SHALL be `min(62vh, 680px)` tall but never taller than the stage box, SHALL be inset 6% of the stage
width from its own side, and SHALL never cover the band. The `actor-left` anchor SHALL carry the
player's standing portrait — the current roster character's portrait, resolved exactly as the
stage portrait was before this requirement, with the truthful placeholder when no image exists —
in exploration, dialogue, and combat mode. The `actor-right` anchor SHALL carry no content. The
portrait anchors are non-interactive art: they SHALL carry no focusable element and SHALL NOT
intercept pointer events, and they MAY sit behind the HUD islands and the command-line row.

At 1920x1080, 1440x900, and 1280x720 no interactive stage anchor (`place`, `hud-left`, `hud-right`,
`band-message`, `band-command`, `command-line`) SHALL overlap another interactive anchor's content,
and the top band's own elements SHALL neither overlap one another nor extend into the HUD island
anchor region: a band element whose content is variable-width SHALL be bounded and truncated rather
than sized by its content. A transient popover opened from a top-band element MAY overlay the
island anchors while open, provided it does not change the band's own rendered box and closes on
Escape and on outside activation; a surface that permanently occupies vertical space SHALL NOT be
introduced into the band this way.

#### Scenario: The stage fills the viewport with layered surfaces
- **WHEN** the shell mounts at 1440x900
- **THEN** the scene backdrop fills the stage box, and the player portrait, the HUD islands, the bottom band, and the command line are layered above it in that order with no page-level scrollbar

#### Scenario: Required surfaces never scroll out of view
- **WHEN** the HUD islands hold more content than their anchor's height, or the dock frame or the narrative holds more content than its band region
- **THEN** the island stack or the band region itself is bounded and scrolls internally, and no required surface is pushed below the visible viewport

#### Scenario: Anchors do not overlap at the minimum viewport
- **WHEN** the shell renders at 1280x720 with every mode-visible surface present
- **THEN** no interactive stage anchor's rendered box intersects another interactive anchor's rendered box

#### Scenario: The top band's own elements do not collide
- **WHEN** the shell renders at 1280x720 with every top-band element present and a maximum-length character name committed
- **THEN** the band's elements render side by side without intersecting, the variable-width element is truncated within its bound, and no band element's box extends into the island anchor region

#### Scenario: A band popover overlays without displacing
- **WHEN** a transient popover is opened from a top-band element
- **THEN** the band's rendered box is unchanged, the popover renders above the island anchors, and Escape or outside activation closes it

#### Scenario: The bottom band keeps one height whatever it holds
- **WHEN** the shell renders at 1920x1080 and the player moves through the exploration root, the interaction workspace, the waiting frame, an empty pane host, the deepest combat frame, and a dialogue exchange with four picks
- **THEN** the bottom band's rendered height is 300px (±1px) in every one of those states, and the message region's and the command region's boxes are unchanged between them

#### Scenario: The band splits two thirds and one third
- **WHEN** the shell renders in exploration mode at 1920x1080, 1440x900, and 1280x720
- **THEN** the message region spans the left two thirds of the band's width and the command region spans the remaining right third (each ±1px), both share the band's top and bottom edges, and in creation mode the command region spans the whole band

#### Scenario: The player portrait stands on the band
- **WHEN** the shell renders in exploration mode at 1920x1080 with a committed roster portrait for the current character
- **THEN** the `actor-left` anchor renders that portrait, its bottom edge coincides with the band's top edge, its height is `min(62vh, 680px)` (±1px), its left edge is 6% of the stage width from the stage's left edge, it holds no focusable element, and the `actor-right` anchor renders no content

#### Scenario: The portrait never outgrows the stage box
- **WHEN** the shell renders at 1280x720, where `min(62vh, 680px)` exceeds the stage box's height
- **THEN** the player portrait's height equals the stage box's height and its top edge is not above the top band's lower edge

#### Scenario: The stage box is at least 65% of the reference viewport
- **WHEN** the shell renders in exploration mode at 1920x1080
- **THEN** the top band is 48px tall, the bottom band is 300px tall (each ±1px), and the stage box between them is at least 702px tall (65% of 1080)

#### Scenario: The top band carries no location or time
- **WHEN** the shell renders in exploration mode with a committed location label and world time
- **THEN** the top band's rendered height is 48px, no element inside the top band states the location label or the world time, and the place anchor below the top band states both

### Requirement: Surface visibility is gated by the committed game mode
The shell SHALL expose the committed mode on the stage root as `data-elosern-mode`, and surface
visibility SHALL be derived from that single attribute. A surface hidden for the current mode SHALL be
removed from rendering with `display:none` — never dimmed, never merely visually hidden — so it leaves
the accessibility tree and the tab order. The matrix SHALL be:

| Surface | exploration | combat | dialogue | creation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| place card (location, world time) | visible | visible | visible | hidden |
| narrative caption (band message region) | visible | visible | visible (dialogue focus) | hidden |
| vitals island (vitals/conditions) | by the vitals rule | visible | by the vitals rule | hidden |
| minimap island | visible | **hidden** | visible | hidden |
| party quickbar island | while the party is non-empty | while the party is non-empty | while the party is non-empty | hidden |
| objective tracker island | visible | visible | visible | hidden |
| player standing portrait | visible | visible | visible | hidden |
| action dock (band command region) | visible | visible | visible (regular exploration form) | visible (creation form, full band width) |
| command line | visible | visible | visible | hidden |
| scene backdrop | visible (exploration stage) | visible (combat stage) | visible (unchanged art) | visible |

While the committed mode is `dialogue` the scene backdrop SHALL keep rendering its committed
exploration art truthfully — the reference's dialogue focus is carried by the dialogue box
itself, not by mutating the backdrop. Per-surface requirements that name their own visible-mode
sets SHALL stay consistent with this matrix. A cell that names a data rule instead of `visible` means
the surface is shown in that mode only while its own requirement's rule holds for the committed state,
and is otherwise hidden the same way (`display:none`, or not rendered at all where that requirement
says so). When a mode change, or a committed revision that turns a
surface's data rule false, hides the surface that currently holds focus, the shell SHALL move focus to
the action dock before the surface is removed, using the existing focus-restore path.

#### Scenario: The minimap disappears in combat
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes from exploration to combat
- **THEN** the minimap island is absent from the DOM layout and from the tab order, and it is not merely dimmed

#### Scenario: The minimap returns on leaving combat
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes from combat back to exploration
- **THEN** the minimap island renders again with the committed `local_map` payload

#### Scenario: Focus is rescued before its surface is hidden
- **WHEN** the focused element belongs to a surface that the incoming mode hides
- **THEN** focus is moved to the action dock before the surface is removed, and no focus is lost to the document body

#### Scenario: Creation mode presents only the creation surfaces
- **WHEN** the committed mode is creation
- **THEN** the place card, the narrative caption, the HUD island stack, the minimap, the player standing portrait, and the command line are absent, and the action dock renders the creation form across the whole bottom band

#### Scenario: Dialogue mode keeps the cockpit visible
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes from exploration to dialogue
- **THEN** the place card, narrative caption, minimap, objective tracker, player standing portrait, action dock, and command line all
  remain rendered, the vitals and party islands keep following the same data rules as in
  exploration, the action dock keeps its regular exploration form
  with every ordinary root affordance present, and only the narrative presentation changes

#### Scenario: Dialogue backdrop keeps its committed art
- **WHEN** the committed mode is dialogue
- **THEN** the scene backdrop renders the same committed exploration art as before the mode
  change, unmodified

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The place card names the current location and the world time
The stage SHALL carry a place card in its `place` anchor, at the stage box's top-left corner below the
top band, while the committed mode is exploration, dialogue, or combat, and SHALL NOT render it in
creation mode. The card SHALL state the current location as its heading and the world date/time
beneath it, and SHALL be the only surface on the stage or in the top band that states either value.
The location SHALL be the best server-authored place name the client already holds, resolved in a
fixed order: the committed `local_map` panel's `current_node` label when that panel is available,
names a current node, that node is present in the panel's nodes, and its label is a non-empty string;
otherwise the committed status panel's actor location label; otherwise the card's own unavailable
placeholder `位置：--`. The world date/time SHALL be the committed world-time label, and the card's own
unavailable placeholder `時間：--` when none is committed. The card SHALL NOT compose a third string
from the two location candidates, SHALL NOT derive a name from any node or room identifier, SHALL NOT
render a raw room key while a committed panel carries the authored place name for the same room, and
SHALL render no raw mode label in place of the location.

The card SHALL wear the HUD island chrome (the translucent panel fill, the backdrop blur, the
hairline border, the shared radius and shadow, all from the shared design tokens), SHALL keep a fixed
height whatever the label lengths, and SHALL truncate a label that exceeds its width with an overflow
indicator while keeping the full label as its accessible text. It SHALL be display-only: no control,
no tab stop, and no dispatch.

#### Scenario: The card names the location and the time
- **WHEN** the shell renders in exploration mode with a committed status location `測試起點` and world time `春季 3 日 · 12:00`, and no `local_map` panel
- **THEN** the place card's heading reads `測試起點`, its second line reads `春季 3 日 · 12:00`, and no other stage or top-band element states either string

#### Scenario: The card names the region, not the raw room key
- **WHEN** the player stands in a wilderness cell whose status location label is the raw room key `Wilderness` while the committed `local_map` panel's current node is labelled 西部丘陵與谷地
- **THEN** the card's heading reads 西部丘陵與谷地, `Wilderness` is rendered nowhere in the card, and no composed string pairing the two appears

#### Scenario: The card falls back to its placeholders
- **WHEN** neither the `local_map` panel nor the status panel supplies a location label, and no world time is committed
- **THEN** the card reads `位置：--` and `時間：--`

#### Scenario: The card keeps its size and is absent in creation
- **WHEN** a location label longer than the card's width commits, and later the committed mode becomes creation
- **THEN** the card's rendered box is unchanged and the label is truncated with its full text still exposed to assistive technology, and in creation mode the place card is not rendered and holds no tab stop
