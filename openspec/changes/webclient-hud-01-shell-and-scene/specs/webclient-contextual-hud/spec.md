## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The WebClient renders a full-bleed cinematic stage with anchored HUD surfaces
The WebClient SHALL render as a full-bleed stage that fills the viewport, with the scene backdrop as
the lowest layer, the narrative caption card above it, the HUD islands above that, the action dock
above those, and the command line topmost among the persistent surfaces. HUD surfaces SHALL be placed
by named stage anchors (`hud-left`, `hud-right`, `feed`, `dock`, `command-line`) rather than by fixed
layout columns, and SHALL NOT be placed inside a scrolling container that can push a required surface
out of view. The dock's reserved height SHALL come from the shared `--dock-h` token, and the narrative
caption and the right-hand HUD stack SHALL be positioned relative to it so they never overlap it. At
both 1440x900 and 1280x720 no stage anchor SHALL overlap another anchor's content.

#### Scenario: The stage fills the viewport with layered surfaces
- **WHEN** the shell mounts at 1440x900
- **THEN** the scene backdrop fills the viewport, and the narrative caption, the HUD islands, the action dock, and the command line are layered above it in that order with no page-level scrollbar

#### Scenario: Required surfaces never scroll out of view
- **WHEN** the HUD islands hold more content than their anchor's height
- **THEN** the island stack itself is bounded and no required surface is pushed below the visible viewport

#### Scenario: Anchors do not overlap at the minimum viewport
- **WHEN** the shell renders at 1280x720 with every mode-visible surface present
- **THEN** no stage anchor's rendered box intersects another anchor's rendered box

### Requirement: Surface visibility is gated by the committed game mode
The shell SHALL expose the committed mode on the stage root as `data-elosern-mode`, and surface
visibility SHALL be derived from that single attribute. A surface hidden for the current mode SHALL be
removed from rendering with `display:none` — never dimmed, never merely visually hidden — so it leaves
the accessibility tree and the tab order. The matrix SHALL be:

| Surface | exploration | combat | creation |
|---|---|---|---|
| narrative caption | visible | visible | hidden |
| HUD island stack (character/vitals/conditions) | visible | visible | hidden |
| minimap island | visible | **hidden** | hidden |
| action dock | visible | visible | visible (creation form) |
| command line | visible | visible | hidden |
| scene backdrop | visible (exploration stage) | visible (combat stage) | visible |

When a mode change hides the surface that currently holds focus, the shell SHALL move focus to the
action dock before the surface is removed, using the existing focus-restore path.

#### Scenario: The minimap disappears in combat
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes from exploration to combat
- **THEN** the minimap island is absent from the DOM layout and from the tab order, and it is not merely dimmed

#### Scenario: The minimap returns on leaving combat
- **WHEN** the committed mode changes from combat back to exploration
- **THEN** the minimap island renders again with the committed `local_map` payload

#### Scenario: Focus is rescued before its surface is hidden
- **WHEN** the focused element belongs to a surface that the incoming mode hides
- **THEN** focus is moved to the action dock before the surface is removed, and no focus is lost to the document body

#### Scenario: Creation mode presents only the creation surfaces
- **WHEN** the committed mode is creation
- **THEN** the narrative caption, the HUD island stack, the minimap, and the command line are absent, and the action dock renders the creation form

### Requirement: The scene backdrop renders the art payload truthfully behind the stage
The stage backdrop SHALL render the committed `art` panel's scene: the same-origin image with
cover-style cropping when the scene status is `done`; the previously rendered image visibly dimmed and
labelled `目前場景圖片生成中` when the scene is pending and a prior image exists; and the mode's
gradient stage otherwise — for a missing, failed, or invalid asset, for a pending scene with no prior
image, and when the `art` panel is unavailable. The backdrop SHALL NOT present an invented image and
SHALL NOT present a stale image as current. The scene label, its alternative text, and any truthful
placeholder label SHALL be rendered as text outside the bitmap, so no required information exists only
inside an image. The gradient stage SHALL differ per mode (exploration, dialogue, combat) and SHALL
carry an inset vignette.

#### Scenario: A done scene paints the stage
- **WHEN** the committed art panel carries a `done` scene with a same-origin URL
- **THEN** the backdrop renders that image cover-cropped behind every HUD surface, and the scene label and alternative text render as text outside the bitmap

#### Scenario: A missing scene degrades to the mode gradient
- **WHEN** the committed art panel carries a missing, failed, or invalid scene
- **THEN** the backdrop renders the current mode's gradient stage with the truthful placeholder label as text, and no image element carries a URL

#### Scenario: An unavailable art panel is indistinguishable from an ungenerated scene
- **WHEN** the `art` panel commits its unavailable form
- **THEN** the backdrop renders the mode gradient stage exactly as for a missing asset, with no broken image frame and no gameplay surface blocked

#### Scenario: A pending scene keeps its prior image labelled
- **WHEN** the scene is pending and a prior scene image is already rendered
- **THEN** the backdrop keeps that image visibly dimmed with the explicit `目前場景圖片生成中` label, and never presents it as the current scene

#### Scenario: The combat stage is visually distinct
- **WHEN** the committed mode is combat and no scene image is available
- **THEN** the backdrop renders the combat gradient stage, visually distinct from the exploration stage

### Requirement: The narrative is a bounded caption whose complete log is reachable in one action
The narrative SHALL render as a bounded caption card at the visual centre of the stage, constrained in
both measure and height so it never grows to fill the stage. The card SHALL carry a single labelled
control that opens a full-log surface presenting the complete retained narrative through the same
markup renderer as the caption — never a second markup path. The full-log surface SHALL be scrollable,
SHALL trap focus while open, SHALL close on Escape, and SHALL restore focus to the control that opened
it. The unread indicator, its polite live region, and its jump-to-latest behaviour SHALL remain on the
caption card and SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: The caption card is bounded
- **WHEN** the narrative holds more lines than the caption card can show
- **THEN** the card scrolls internally within its bounded height and does not expand to fill the stage

#### Scenario: The complete log opens in one action
- **WHEN** the player activates the caption card's full-log control
- **THEN** the full-log surface opens showing the complete retained narrative, rendered through the same markup renderer as the caption

#### Scenario: The full-log surface returns focus on Escape
- **WHEN** the full-log surface is open and the player presses Escape
- **THEN** it closes and focus returns to the control that opened it

#### Scenario: The unread indicator is unchanged
- **WHEN** new narrative lines arrive while the caption card is scrolled away from the latest line
- **THEN** the unread indicator states its count and jump action and is announced through its polite live region exactly as before

### Requirement: An open drawer or overlay dims the stage behind it
When a drawer or a full-screen overlay is open, the shell SHALL mark the stage so the surfaces behind
the open surface are visually recessed, and SHALL clear that mark only when no drawer and no overlay
remain open. The recession SHALL be visual only: it SHALL NOT be used in place of hiding a
mode-gated surface, and it SHALL be disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion` for its transition while
the recessed state itself still applies.

#### Scenario: Opening a drawer recesses the stage
- **WHEN** a drawer or overlay opens
- **THEN** the stage behind it is visually recessed and the mark is present on the stage root

#### Scenario: The mark clears only when everything is closed
- **WHEN** two surfaces are open and one closes
- **THEN** the stage stays recessed until the last open surface closes
