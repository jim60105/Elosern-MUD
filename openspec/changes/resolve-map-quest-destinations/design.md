# Design

## Context

Source of truth: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-world-map-drawer-design.md`, introduced by approved commit `9a9200b45c406a3d28ec15b27fa4cf04380151ba`, and parent architecture `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-ai-mud-engine-design.md`. §9 row 4 is split into this 5h shared destination resolver and publish-area-map-panel (8h); the combined resolver, four layer adapters and protocol tests exceed 8h. See proposal.md for motivation and prerequisites. The prototype is a layout/interaction reference only; its old river, forest and political geometry must never become runtime data.

## Goals / Non-Goals

Implement only the assigned slice described below. No elevation, travel automation, new quests, shipping mechanics, compatibility layer or data migration. Existing canonical identities, knowledge ownership and deterministic offline play remain intact.

## Decisions

Read accepted quest runtime state using existing definitions/locator parsing; do not infer destinations from player prose or browser data. Keep result internal to the server with canonical optional area node/map identity and world cell position; ANCHOR and GRID world displays intentionally use the settlement/anchor cell rather than applying an arbitrary local offset. Existing instance/interior coordinates remain absent.

For species hunts compute the nearest legal point in the amended target region using deterministic distance and lexicographic coordinate tie order; use existing region bounds and passability helpers, not the old rectangular classifier assumptions or a world scan per map view. Resolve the actual authored monster-site cell. Unknown/unbound/unsupported destinations produce no fabricated marker. This helper does not serialize exact world positions to browsers; world-map filtering/50 km rounding is owned by publish-world-map-panel and out-of-area area markers use bearing/distance.

No change to acceptance, tracking, completion, spawn or quest generation. Logging for cross-system failures uses the observability facade; isolate an unresolvable commission rather than suppressing valid markers.

## Risks / Trade-offs

A GRID world position is the settlement anchor cell, while its area marker needs actual canonical node identity. Combining them would plot a local quest at the wrong room or leak cross-map coordinates.

## Implementation verification contract

Implementation MUST run the smallest affected Evennia label, Node file, Vitest file, or managed browser class, never broad suites or CI shard commands locally. Every local test command must stay below ten minutes. Use `uv run --locked --env-file=<path> evennia test --settings test_settings.py --keepdb <focused.label>`, with `MUD_TEST_SETTINGS=1` in that env file. Pure tool tests use a focused `uv run --locked python -m unittest <module>`; client units use a single-file runner.

Register every new/moved non-browser package test module in exactly one `.github/evennia-shards.json` shard; register every new browser class/method in `.github/browser-shards.json`. Keep synthetic mechanism fixtures independent of production lore. Production content integrity tests need a first-line `Data-contract test: <reason>` and matching `tools/test_data_freeze.json` entry.

Use `tools.spec_traceability list` to obtain canonical IDs, never guess them. Because active deltas are not indexed, obtain new/retired IDs by running `uv run --locked python -m tools.spec_traceability list` against a disposable equivalent spec tree with these deltas merged, using `--repo-root <equivalent-root>` before the `list` or `check` subcommand. Apply literal `covers_requirement` annotations to real discoverable Python assertions (including managed browser assertions for client behavior); do not leave unknown active-delta IDs in the unsynced repository. Run `check` against the equivalent merged tree with those tests before sync, and the normal root `check` after sync. A pre-sync root pass alone does not establish coverage of this change. Existing IDs remain checked at root; CI alone runs full evidence verification.

All changed server, movement and panel logging uses named imports from `world.observability`, stable snake_case events and contextual business identifiers. Changed cross-system/I/O boundaries emit the applicable catalog event; exception branches re-raise, log through the facade with `exc=`, or carry a reasoned lint exemption. Patch the caller's log binding in tests. Run the observability lint with focused tests when a logging path changes. Never add freeze-list entries.

Before implementation handoff run `uv run --locked python -m tools.contract_gate` and `openspec validate <change> --strict`. Update existing development/game documentation for changed behavior; do not add unrelated features, migrations or compatibility aliases. Proposal creation does not run implementation tests.
