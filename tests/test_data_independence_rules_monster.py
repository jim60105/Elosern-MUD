"""Repository contract: the monster/aftermath test migration stays closed.

The migrate-rules-monster-tests-off-real-data change removed every ledger
exemption for the fourteen ``world/rules/tests`` modules it migrated. This
contract re-derives the gate over exactly those files: none may carry a ledger
DEBT or CONTRACT exemption, and all must hold zero lint findings — so a future
edit that reintroduces a shipped identifier cannot silently re-register debt.
Every manifest file is a pure behavior suite: the shipped-content claims that
had to survive relocation (rulebook tier-archetype mechanics, flee thresholds,
restock/causality mechanics) are exercised through runtime vocabulary probes
and file-local synthetic rows instead of registered contract files, so the
whole manifest stays debt-free and finding-free.
